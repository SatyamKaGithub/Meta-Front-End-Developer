# Knowledge check: Events and errors

1. When handling a click event in react, you should use the following attribute:
    - `on-click`
    - `Onclick`
    - `onClick`
    - `OnClick`
    ```
    Answer: onClick
    Explanation: The attribute is the same as in vanilla JavaScript, except for the capital C letter. 
    ```

2. Inside a JSX element, you can assign a JSX expression to the onClick handler to handle a click in React.
    - False
    - True
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: In fact, you have to do it.
    ```

3. You can place an opening and a closing parenthesis after the name of the event-handling function that you assign to the onClick attribute.
    - False
    - True
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: Contrary to plain JavaScript, you cannot invoke an event-handling function to handle an event such as the onClick. That’s one of the differences between JSX and plain JavaScript syntax.
    ```

4. The `try...catc`h syntax can be used in React in certain cases.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: You can handle event-handling errors using the try...catch syntax. 
    ```

5. Choose the valid example of an onclick event handler.
    - ```js
        <button onclick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
      ```
    - ```js
        <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>
      ```
    - ```js
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
      ```
    - ```js
        <button on-click=”handleClick”>Click me</button>
      ```
    ```
    Answer: <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    Explanation: This code will handle click events on the button by invoking the handleClick function.
    ```
